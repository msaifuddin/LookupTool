# Lookup Tool
This tool leverages the MS Graph API v1.0 to quickly search for user accounts and their associated devices, with the ability to perform reverse lookups as well.

The tool uses an interactive browser login via the InteractiveBrowserCredential, with a simulated Graph PowerShell SDK Client ID to identify the application, authenticate the user, and obtain an access token required to query device data.

No special requirements (e.g., PIM activation) are neededâ€”just use your *special* account. 

Any limitations are based on MS Graph's query constraints.

## Instructions
1. Login and search.
